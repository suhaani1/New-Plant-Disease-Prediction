# New-Plant-Disease-Prediction
🌿 Plant Disease Prediction Using AI
This project aims to detect plant diseases from leaf images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It helps farmers and gardeners identify plant health issues early, ensuring timely intervention and better crop yield.
📌 Features
🔍 Predicts diseases from images of plant leaves.

🌱 Supports multiple crops (e.g., tomato, potato, corn, etc.).

🧠 Powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

🖼️ Image preprocessing for better accuracy.

📊 Displays disease name and brief treatment suggestions.
